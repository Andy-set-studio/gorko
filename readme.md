## Getting started

First up, install Gorko:

```bash
npm install gorko
```

In your Sass (SCSS in this case), import Gorko like so:

```scss
@import '../path/to/your/node_modules/gorko/gorko.scss';
```

This will generate utility classes based on the default configuration. To configure it for yourself, take this default, and create your own. Once it is created **import your config before Gorko**, like this:

```bash
@import 'config';
```

## Configuration

This is the default configuration. It is recommended that you use it as your base for your own configuration.

```scss
/// BASE SIZE
/// All calculations are based on this. Itâ€™s recommended that
/// you keep it at 1rem because that is the root font size. You
/// can set it to whatever you like and whatever unit you like.
///
$gorko-base-size: 1rem !default;

/// SIZE SCALE
/// This is a Major Third scale that powers all the utilities that
/// it is relevant for (font-size, margin, padding). All items are
/// calcuated off the base size, so change that and cascade across
/// your whole project.
///
$gorko-size-scale: (
  '300': $gorko-base-size * 0.8,
  '400': $gorko-base-size,
  '500': $gorko-base-size * 1.25,
  '600': $gorko-base-size * 1.6,
  '700': $gorko-base-size * 2,
  '900': $gorko-base-size * 3
) !default;

/// COLORS
/// Colors are shared between backgrounds and text by default.
/// You can also use them to power borders, fills or shadows, for example.
///
$gorko-colors: (
  'dark': #1a1a1a,
  'light': #f3f3f3
) !default;

/// CORE CONFIG
/// This powers everything from utility class generation to breakpoints
/// to enabling/disabling pre-built components/utilities.

```

### `$gorko-base-size` (optional)

The base size for the size ratio calculations. It is only required for the default configuration.

### `$gorko-size-scale` (optional)

This takes the base size and by default, generates a **major third** size scale. This can be set to whatever scale you like.

If this is not set, the `get-size` function will use the default configuration.

### `$gorko-colors` (optional)

A collection of key/value pairs that by default, generate text and background colour utilities.

If this is not set, the `get-color` function will use the default configuration.

### `$gorko-config` (required)

ðŸš¨ Without this set, Gorko wonâ€™t work. ðŸš¨

It contains all of the utility class definitions and breakpoint definitions that the generator and mixins use.

You can add as many or as little utility class definitions as you likeâ€”likewise for breakpoint definitions.

### Breakpoints

The `breakpoints` map in `$gorko-config` defines media queries for the utility class generator. By default, the are set as follows:

```scss
'breakpoints': (
	'sm': '(min-width: 36em)',
	'md': '(min-width: 48em)',
	'lg': '(min-width: 62em)'
)
```

You can add as many or as little of these as you like and call them whatever you like. The only requirement is that the value is a valid media query.

## Utility Class Generator

The utility class generator loops through `$gorko-config` looking for items that have a valid utility class structure. The following structure is required to generate a utility class:

```scss
'width':('items':('full':'100%','half': '50%',
	),
	'output': 'standard',
	'property': 'width'
),;
```

The first key is the name of the utility and that contains a Sass map. Inside that map, you need to have the following: - `items`: a map of key/value pairs which link a utility class to a CSS propertyâ€™s value - `output`: this must be `responsive` or `standard`. If you set it to `responsive`, it will generate the same utility class for **every breakpoint that is defined**. - `property`: the [CSS property](https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/) that this utility controls.

#### Example outputs

The above structure would output the following utility classes:

```css
.width-full {
  width: 100%;
}

.width-half {
  width: 50%;
}
```

If we set the `output` to be `responsive`, with the default `breakpoints` defined, the output would be as follows:

```css
.width-full {
  width: 100%;
}

.width-half {
  width: 50%;
}

@media screen and (min-width: 36em) {
  .sm\:width-full {
    width: 100%;
  }

  .sm\:width-half {
    width: 50%;
  }
}

@media screen and (min-width: 48em) {
  .md\:width-full {
    width: 100%;
  }

  .md\:width-half {
    width: 50%;
  }
}

@media screen and (min-width: 62em) {
  .lg\:width-full {
    width: 100%;
  }

  .lg\:width-half {
    width: 50%;
  }
}
```

## Sass functions

There are a couple of handy functions that give you access to configuration settings.

### `get-color($key: string)`

Takes the passed `$key` and attempts to retrieve a match from `$gorko-colors`.

#### Example

Using the default config:

```scss
$dark = get-color('dark'); // #1a1a1a
```

### `get-config-value($key: string, $group: string)`

Returns back a 1 dimensional (key value pair) config value if available.

#### Example

Using the default config:

```scss
$light-weight: get-config-value('light', 'weight'); // 300
```

### `get-size($ratio-key: string)`

Tries to match the passed `$ratio-key` with the `$gorko-size-scale`. Returns null if it canâ€™t find a match.

#### Example

Using the default config:

```scss
$my-size: get-size('500'); // 1.25rem
```

## Sass mixins

### `apply-utility($key: string, $value-key: string)`

Grab the property and value of one of the `$gorko-config` utilities that the generator will generate a class for.

#### Example

Using the default config:

```scss
.my-element {
  @include apply-utility('weight', 'bold'); // font-weight: bold;
}
```

### `media-query($key: string)`

Pass in the key of one of your breakpoints set in `$gorko-config['breakpoints']` and this mixin will generate the media query with your configured value.

#### Example

Using the default config:

```scss
.my-element {
  @include media-query('md') {
    background: goldenrod;
  }
}
```

Output:

```css
@media (min-width: 48em) {
  .my-element {
    background: goldenrod;
  }
}
```
